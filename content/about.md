**Hi there!ðŸ‘‹** My name is Tegar Most people refer to call me as ryzen. and I am a passionate 3D artist currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I have a deep love for blending art and technology, which has led me to create unique and captivating 3D artworks.

My journey as a 3D artist began a few years ago, and since then, I have been dedicated to perfecting my craft. I specialize in character modeling, animation, and rendering, and I take pride in pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the digital art world.

In addition to my studies and artistic pursuits, I have ventured into the world of NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). I sell my digital creations on the Solana blockchain, a platform known for its efficiency and low transaction costs. This allows art enthusiasts and collectors to own a piece of my work in the form of unique, verifiable assets.

Currently, I am studying Computer Science at Binasarana Informatika, where I am expanding my knowledge in areas such as programming, algorithms, and software development. My academic background complements my artistic skills, enabling me to create more technically advanced and innovative projects.

When I'm not creating 3D art or studying, I enjoy exploring virtual reality, playing video games, and staying updated with the latest trends in technology and digital art.

Thank you for visiting my site! Feel free to explore my portfolio to see some of my work, and don't hesitate to reach out if you would like to collaborate or learn more about my journey.
