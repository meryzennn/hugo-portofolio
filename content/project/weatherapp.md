# **Weather App**

**The Weather App is a simple web application that displays current weather information based on the user's entered location. Featuring a clean and responsive interface, this app provides weather data including temperature, weather description, humidity, and wind speed. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data.**

```markdown
Features
- **Location Search**: Enter a city name to get the current weather information.
- **Weather Information**: Displays temperature, weather description, humidity, and wind speed.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized layout for various devices.
- **Error Messages**: Shows an error message if the location is not found.

**How to Use**

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   https://github.com/meryzennn/weather-app.git
   ```

2. **Open HTML File**

   Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to run the application.

3. **Enter City**

   Type the name of a city into the search box and click the search button to view the weather data.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: Main HTML file containing the structure and elements of the app.
- **style.css**: CSS file for styling and layout.
- **script.js**: JavaScript file handling the application logic and interacting with the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **images/**: Directory containing icons and images used in the app.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- OpenWeatherMap API (for weather data)
- Boxicons (for icons)

## How It Works

1. **Weather Search**:
   - When the user enters a city name and clicks the search button, the app sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API.
   - If the city is found, the app displays the temperature, weather description, humidity, and wind speed for that city.
   - If the city is not found, the app shows an error message.

2. **UI Update**:
   - The app updates the weather icon based on the weather type received from the API.
   - It adjusts the display based on the received data, including temperature and weather description.
